											<li>
												The case study of “Abusive Workplace Behavior” as provided in the Code of Ethics from ACM has been carefully reviewed. In that case, Max exploited his position as the team’s 
												technical leader to erupt his team members with verbal and personal attacks. This illustrated that superiors often take advantage of their superiorship to bully 
												their inferiors verbally and in other forms. In many jurisdictions, it is an offence to publicly insult another or causing reputational damage of another. 
												Such behaviour also renders the person concerned a negative impression on the others. This is particularly the case in a work environment where interconnections 
												between colleagues are loose and one’s image could be easily damaged by improper comments made especially from the superior level.<br>
												In addition, Max was also alleged to have committed the offence of sex discrimination by deliberately removing the names of his women 
												team members from journal manuscript and blocking their participation for professional events. It was clearly a demonstration of an 
												abuse of power to sexually discriminate women in the workplace. As the attacks came from the upper level, it naturally flowed and 
												affected the values of the group and the society, resulting in more women facing sexual abuses, as is the case in India where the 
												societal position of women is significantly lower.<br>
												As a comparison, Max’s behaviours also violated two principles of the BCS Code of Conduct, namely:<br>
												1. sexual discrimination against his women subordinate,<br>
												2. failure to uphold his duty to relevant authority to carry out his responsibilities professionally.

											<li style="font-weight: 18px;font-weight: bold;">Summary Post:</li>
											<li>In the Industry 4.0 era, many enterprises try to transform the process of their production or services with new technologies such as AI, big data, cloud computing and robotics.  Enterprises expect the implementation of new technologies can improve their productivity, save costs and/or acquire bigger market share.  Most new technologies applied in Industry 4.0 rely on interconnected networks which  inevitably brings security challenges.  In a public interconnected network, for example, the Internet, the most popular interconnected network in the world due to its relatively low access cost, there are always malicious activities taken place.  How to effectively defend against cyber threats is one of the major issues when enterprises consider investing into the implementation of this kind of technology.   Such investment should be long term and without interruption as new cyber threats appear constantly.


												The rise of Industry 4.0 also has an impact on the society.  New technology evolves much faster than social development, causing distress to the public and impacting morality or the law.  For instance, the government is installing IP cameras on the streets for security monitoring purposes.  Citizens do not expect to be recorded when they simply walk on the street.  They feel that their privacy rights have been infringed.  This causes tension between technological development and societal views.  A fair balance should be struck.  However, given the extraordinary rapid growth of technology, it is of doubt that whether societal development could keep up the pace.  This can be seen as potential civil risks of Industry 4.0. 
												
												
												In the transformation to Industry 4.0, enterprises should conduct in depth evaluation on how to balance the revenue and resources investment so as to get the most benefits out of the new technologies.   Investing sufficient infrastructure resources and manpower is essential for the deployment of these new technologies.  Continual assessment of cyber risks is also crucial because most of the new technologies in Industry 4.0 is constantly updating every day.<br/><br/>

											<li>Firstly, if the organization were to send email communications to individuals at a

												the general rule of requiring consent is fulfilled. If there is no prior consent, the
												organization must ensure that the email sent related solely to the recipient’s
												commercial or official activity and is a genuine business-to-business communication.
												In such case, the communication is more likely to fall within the exception allowed
												by the E-Privacy Regulations. Furthermore, the organization should include an opt-
												out mechanism in all their electronic direct marketing communication. If the
												recipient, regardless of whether it is an individual or a company, notifies the
												organization that they do not consent to receiving their emails, the organization
												should cease to send such emails.</li>

											<li style="font-weight: 18px;font-weight: bold;">Collaborative Discussion 2 - Initial Post<br/>Read Spring et al (2021) and then answer the questions about CVSS</li>
											<li><br/>The CVSS v3 0 specification has been criticized by the authors for its lack of transparency on the formula creation process.  The CVSS equation was developed based on data from experts who ranked 100 vulnerabilities.  There was nothing about this ranking process documented in the specification.



												I agreed with this critique, as the authors commented the initial ranking of the vulnerabilities affects the resulting equation for assigning CVSS scores.  Any assessment system should provide its ranking information as much as possible.  Generally, users use the assessment system just because of the popularity of it or the reputation of the organization who made it, and not realizing the details of all the processes behind the system.  Or a not-so-resourceful security team does not have the opportunity to explore the different choices of systems in the market within a limited time frame.  However, these should not hinder the system from providing the ranking information with more transparency.  
												
												
												
												Out of the alternatives given by the authors, in my opinion SSVC should replace CVSS.  CVSS is used to assess the technical severity of a vulnerability and does not account for context whereas SSVC is used to fit the context with each stakeholder’s unique requisites and does not only provide a score, but also what actions need to do next.<br/><br/>

											<li style="font-weight: 18px;font-weight: bold;">My response to my peer’s post about CVSS and SSVC:</li>
											<li>It is a good view of you Thomas, as you mentioned in the post. I also agree with you and Spring et al that the same vulnerability, when scored by two professionals, the result of it may fall in different severity levels.

												The difference in the scoring result may cause confusion to some organizations whose security teams lack the expertise and experience to correctly evaluate the severity level and the risk the vulnerability could bring. Misleading risk assessment poses great danger to organizations – an under-assessment may cause the organizations losses in not just monetary terms but also their reputation in their respective industry, conversely, an over-assessment may lead to unnecessary cumbersome mitigations.
												
												In institutions such as finance, medical, public transportation and military, accurate risk management is of utmost importance and there is no room for tolerance due to their impact on the general public. I believe these institutions have enough resources to complement this deficiency if they are using CVSS. However, small enterprises are less resourceful. All they need is a quick and simple way to help them evaluate their business risk. That is why I think CVSS can be used commonly.
												
												I also agree SSVC can replace CVSS because SSVC can complement the deficiency of CVSS.<br/><br/>

											<li style="font-weight: 18px;font-weight: bold;">A summary on CVSS and its alternative:</li>
											<li>As a Vulnerability Scoring System, CVSS provides a way to indicate the severity of each vulnerability by using a qualitative measure.  Although CVSS is commonly used by security teams in organizations, it has some weaknesses with it.  Its equation is not enough transparent and the formula is not clear.  The main purpose of CVSS is to score severity of each vulnerability to enable organizations to prioritize responses by making reference to the score.  However, CVSS is not a measure for risk and it does not cover to account for the context and consequences, but it does not mean that it cannot be used for risk assessment.  For some small organizations and enterprises whose resources are tight, probably they do not have a strong security team to build up an integrity threats and risk assessment system.   They may just need a simple indicator to tell them the severity of vulnerability, then patch the vulnerability accordingly.

												On the other hand, SSVC can be certainly used for risk assessment.  Compared with CVSS, SSVC provides more parameters for risk assessment, it then can account for the context and consequences, and is therefore very useful for vulnerability remediation.  As a tool for decision process SSVC is more suitable to be used by an individual infosec professional to make decisions for vulnerabilities remediation.
												
												Both CVSS and SSVC are good assessment tools for vulnerability and risk assessment.  It depends on how infosec professionals use it in different situations.  The most important thing is that infosec professionals should certainly understand these tools, not limited to CVSS and SSVC, and combine the environment and resources factors to make the most out of these tools for their organizations and enterprises.
												
												All scoring or assessment systems have their formula, assessment, prediction and target.  None of these systems can completely replace one another.  A good infosec professional always chooses the most suitable ones for themselves.<br/><br/>

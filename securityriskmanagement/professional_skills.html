										<h1>Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan - Security Risk Management</h1>

									<ul style="list-style: none;padding-left: 0px;">
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">From the learning journey of this module, I have acquired substantial knowledge
										about cyber safety and risk assessment and their respective management technique.
										My present and past job duties involve a lot of handling of cyber security matters,
										with a major part on the dealing with vulnerabilities of various software and
										hardware. Prior to studying this module, in my previous work I used to simply set a
										fixed time to complete the remediation according to the severity of the
										vulnerabilities, without conducting too much assessment on the possible risks. Now
										I will and have actually applied the knowledge that I learned from this module to
										facilitate my work. For instance, I have employed the quantitative risk assessment
										technique to analyze the potential risks so that I got a clearer plan on how to
										prioritize mitigation activities. This technique has significantly improved my work
										efficiencies and produced better results. In addition, this module has equipped me
										with ample knowledge on Business Continuity (BC) and Drill Recovery (DR) site
										deployment. I now understand the different kinds of deployment criteria, allowing
										me to choose the most suitable deployment plan for various systems of which their
										Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirements
										might be disparate. Intending to finding out the most suitable DR plan for our case
										(Pampered Pets), I have further attempted to try out the various cloud platforms and
										built up application and database (DB) servers on different geographical locations in
										order to comply with the rules of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
										Moreover, I established DB server cluster and tried several synchronization methods
										and used the application load balance services provided by the cloud platform to test
										the High Available (HA) architecture auto failover solution. In addition, I simulated
										different scenarios to figure out different RTO and RPO by manual as well as auto
										failover so as to meet the requirements.</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">In the team project, I was mainly responsible for identifying and assessing the level
										of potential risks. This sub-part clearly pointed out the possible cyber threats that
										might come about, the vulnerabilities and the respective risks. It was a crucial and
										key part of the project as it set out the foundation and direction on how the issues
										should be solved.</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">The team had performed excellently in terms of team spirit, efficiency and
										effectiveness and I have enjoyed working with my team members and felt privileged
										to have the opportunity to work with professionals like them. In our first team
										meeting through mobile instant messaging app (Whatsapp), we had been able to
										quickly put together an outline of the project. We actively exchanged ideas and
										thoughts and summarized a clear work plan. Each of the members picked and chose
										the part they felt comfortable with and is best suitable for themselves based on their
										own ability and experience and worked in accordance to the sequence and timeline
										of the sub-parts. We continued to discuss and updated each other on the progress
										of the project. The team demonstrated good discipline as all of us had completed
										their respective part on time, without the need to chase anybody for submission. In
										the end the project was consolidated by the team member who is proficient in the
										organization of report and all members had reviewed and agreed upon on it before
										submission.</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">In this moment where we are about to finish this module, I deeply recognized the
										benefit of spending all the hours and effort studying it. All those vague concepts
										that were used to be in my head have eventually become solid knowledge, providing
										a sound foundation on practical skills and organizational ability which would greatly
										assist me with my work at present and in the long run. Although I was the
										Operational Risk Officer (ORO) of the department, I tended to carry out my duties
										based on pre-existing organizational guidelines to complete the Risk Assessment
										(RA) or Business Impact Assessment (BIA) without performing in-depth assessment
										and analysis. From now on I would adopt the knowledge that I have learned and
										apply on not just these specific issues but also extend it to the projects that I handle,
										with an aim to perfect them. Furthermore, this was the first time that I used Github
										platform and had discovered that its function could assist me with planning for my
										job. Definitely, I will try to incorporate this useful tool for the management of my
										future projects.</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">As much as I have hoped and tried to commit to all the elements of this module, it is
										with utmost regret that due to conflict of work schedule I could not attend the real-
										time seminars and participate in the live debates, discussions and presentations. To
										a certain extent it did make me feel anxious as I was unsure if there would be any
										penalty on my marks for the absences. I wished there would be clearer guidelines
										on the attendance requirement and its impact on the grading scheme, ideally these
										information were available before program enrollment so that students could assess
										whether this is the online course that suits them from all aspects and their ability to
										complete it. After all, it is another facet of risk assessment and management, isnâ€™t
										it?</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Last but not least, I would like to thank our tutor Mr. Necat for his teaching and
										guidance. Through this module I have learned notable practical knowledge on risk
										management and its importance, which would absolutely elevate my work capability
										to the next level.</li>

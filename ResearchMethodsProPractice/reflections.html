									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">As the final module preceding the capstone project, the experiences and various skills gained through 
										the learning activities in this subject have proven immensely helpful for implementing the capstone project itself.</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">The module commenced with analyzing different study cases to understand the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct currently prevailing 
										within the technology industry.  This process revealed that the value of a research project extends beyond its core content; every person and matter involved must 
										be handled with proper ethics and professional integrity to truly constitute a correct research project.  Case analyses based on the ACM Code of Ethics highlighted 
										numerous situations that likely exist in reality.  In the actual business world, corporate entities, inherently driven by profit, continuously pursue higher earnings as 
										their paramount goal and seemingly as a matter of course.  As a member of any organization, an individual is subtly influenced by corporate culture.  Day after day, immersed 
										in routine work, one may gradually forget their initial professional passion and ethical conduct.  This erosion is reflected in the increasing prevalence of technology-related 
										fraud in contemporary society.  If we exclude extreme examples, such as professionals coerced by criminal groups into conducting specialized technological crimes, there remain 
										many technology practitioners who, fully aware their work involves fraudulent activities, choose to ignore the potential illegality for substantial financial gain.  
										This fundamentally contradicts the behavior expected of a genuine professional.</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">The module also involved the practical implementation of the literature review, an essential component of any research project.  This task required 
										extensive reading of academic literature related to the chosen research topic.  Initially, effectively structuring and classifying the vast quantity of source material was 
										challenging, leading to a superficial presentation of information and a lack of a coherent theoretical framework to substantiate the discussion.  This ultimately resulted in 
										a literature review that was potentially inadequate.  Nevertheless, this very experience provided valuable insights that will undoubtedly contribute to developing more robust 
										and effective literature reviews in the future.</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">During the mid-phase of the module, various data collection methodologies were introduced.  These methods differed somewhat from those 
										typically employed in previous workplace projects.  The primary distinction lay in the target audience; when data collection surveys are distributed to colleagues within 
										the same company, participation is often perceived as a job requirement, which significantly reduces the difficulty of acquiring data.  Consequently, the systematic 
										methods introduced in the module served to complement and address specific gaps in my prior experiential skill set.</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Following the introduction of data collection techniques, the curriculum progressed to practicing various data analysis and statistical 
										procedures.  The statistical methods, in particular, were initially quite difficult to comprehend fully.  Even successfully computing sample statistics by closely 
										following exercise guides did not immediately foster a deep understanding of the underlying principles and assumptions.  Further independent research confirmed that 
										statistics is itself a highly specialized discipline.  The dual challenge of performing statistically sound analysis and then effectively presenting the results through 
										accessible, user-friendly graphical interfaces tailored for diverse audiences is notably complex.  This aspect is also critically important for a research report's 
										impact.  Since the ultimate audience for any research is human, if that audience cannot effectively interpret the meaning and significance of the presented data, the study 
										will inevitably struggle to demonstrate its validity and reliability.</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">The concluding segment of the module encompassed research paper writing and the creation of e-portfolios.  The instruction on research paper 
										writing constituted a particularly valuable component.  The skills it introduced - clarity of purpose, structural coherence, and persuasive argumentation - are widely 
										applicable across numerous professional fields.  This is especially true for researchers in technology research and development, where the ability to draft a compelling 
										research proposal with clear objectives, a sound methodology, and a structure that gains approval from the stakeholder is often crucial for securing the opportunity to 
										conduct the research.  Through the practical exercise of developing a complete research proposal, meticulously following the project requirements based on the BCS Project 
										Requirements, I acquired significant and practical experience in academic writing.  Regarding e-portfolios, given our pervasive internet age, a professional 
										self-introduction via an e-portfolio can potentially unlock new opportunities.  However, this practice concurrently introduces the risk of personal information leakage.  
										It is crucial to recognize that even portfolios with restricted access, by virtue of being stored on internet servers, perpetually face the threat of cyber attacks.  
										This inherent trade-off between visibility and security presents a dilemma worthy of deeper discussion.</li>
									<li style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion:</p>The diverse activities within this module effectively guided students through the essential conditions, sequential steps, 
										and practical methodologies required for a successful capstone project.  Through its carefully structured, progressive learning activities, the module fostered a comprehensive 
										understanding of how to construct a research project from inception to completion.  A notable example was the generative AI reflection activity, which, by keeping pace with 
										contemporary advancements, prompted students to engage with the ethical concerns arising from the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, one of the most 
										prominent technologies today.  It successfully stimulated critical thinking regarding both the positive potential and negative ramifications of this transformative technology.  
										The necessary statistical analysis for research reports was reinforced through practical exercises, ensuring these technical competencies were acquired.  
										Similarly, the literature review and research proposal presentation provided indispensable hands-on experience and yielded constructive feedback from the tutor.  
										In summary, the module conclusively and effectively provides substantial and highly practical assistance, directly preparing students for the challenges of the upcoming 
										capstone project.</li>
